  "body": "# Showbones\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod saves the locations of player bones in a text file\r\n\"database\" in the world directory. Player can use new chat command \"/showbones\" to\r\nshow waypoints that are visible anywhere in world showing the \r\ndirection and distance to all recorded bones up to the server\r\nlimit (3 by default). Waypoints are removed and updated as player, or other\r\nplayers dig them. If player is online when another player digs\r\nthier bones, a chat message will appear letting him/her know of\r\nthe crime. :)\r\n\r\nIf a player has left more than the server limit (default 3) of bones lying\r\naround the world, the oldest ones are removed from the world as\r\nthe new one is created. Waypoints are numbered 1 - server limit.\r\nThe newest/latest bones would be 1. Bones waypoints may be hidden\r\nby using the /showbones chat command again.\r\n \r\nThis mod was created in hopes relieving the frusteration of players and\r\nadmins trying to locate lost bones. There is also the added bonus that \r\nserver admins will no longer need to clean up messy, discarded bones from\r\nall around the server. This mod will only track bones lost from the time\r\nof install. It also will not track bones placed from inventory.\r\n\r\n* License:\t     Source code LGPL 2.1\r\n* Credits:           PilzAdam - The creator of the bones mod.\r\n                     Some code copied (on_punch function) for a needed override.\r\n                     \r\n* Adds chat command: /showbones\r\n* Adds privilege:    None at this time\r\n\r\n* Dependencies:      bones\r\n\r\n* Forum link:        To be announced\r\n* Known bugs:        To be announced when discovered.\r\n\r\nCode quality: I don't want to talk about it.
